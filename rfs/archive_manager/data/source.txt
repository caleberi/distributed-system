I FEEL I’VE KNOWN YOU

Sometimes I feel I’ve been in another world;
Sometimes I feel I know there’s a world beyond;
Sometimes I feel I’ve stood in this space with you;
This space and moment of today in our first
Meeting of eyes—
Without a word, I knew I knew you as I had before;
I knew I wanted you as I did before;
I knew I wanted you and had to have you
As much as I fought my feelings for you,
And you—yours for me.
So come quietly to me in peace and burning
Desire, and let me receive you around me as one;
I’ve waited long across lifetimes for your face
In the parade of many—
Come let us savor the souls of our many lives
Before, and fulfill the destiny of our
Long-lasting desires;
Come to our dining to feast first upon the spirit
Of each other’s energy;
Face your face to mine in sweet teasing of
Dessert’s patient waiting;
Rush not the sacred sensuality of our prolonged
Romance asleep;
Come, come, come my love.
